## Mascot

The Syzitus mascot, named Syzzie, is derived from the original Ruqqus mascot.

## Terminology

{{ 'SITE_NAME' | app_config }} is broken into numerous smaller messaging and commenting boards focused around a variety of topics. These boards are called "Guilds". Guild names always start with a `+` symbol, and are usually (though not always) named after their topic of interest. For example, [+news](/+news) is a Guild focused on sharing and discussion of news and current events.

The users who create and moderate Guilds are called "Guildmasters". Guildmasters are regular users, and have no affiliation with {{ 'SITE_NAME' | app_config }} beyond having a {{ 'SERVER_NAME' | app_config }} account.

Users can submit posts to Guilds. They can also can add comments as replies to posts or other comments.

Guildmasters cannot hide or remove content. They can "kick" off-topic posts out of their guild. Such content then appears in [+general](/+general), an unmoderated Guild that functions as a catch-all area. Similarly, Guildmasters can "yank" content from +general into their own guild. When a post is kicked or yanked, all of its comments move with it. 

When referring to the {{ 'SITE_NAME' | app_config }} social media platform, use "{{ 'SITE_NAME' | app_config }}" or "{{ 'SERVER_NAME' | app_config }}".

When referring to the operators of {{ 'SITE_NAME' | app_config }}, use "{{ 'SITE_NAME' | app_config }} staff", "{{ 'SITE_NAME' | app_config }} owners", or similar phrasing.

Users of the {{ 'SITE_NAME' | app_config }} platform should be called "{{ 'SITE_NAME' | app_config }} users".

## Coloring

The name of the {{ 'SITE_NAME' | app_config }} color is "{{ 'COLOR_PRIMARY_NAME' | app_config }}". Its RGB hex code is #{{ 'COLOR_PRIMARY' | app_config | upper }}.
