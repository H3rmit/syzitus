# Welcome to Syzitus

Ruqqus is gone, but the free speech dreams live on. Syzitus, loosly named after the Greek word for "discuss" ("συζητώ"), is a spiritual successor to the Ruqqus platform. It shares much of the same code and operating principles as Ruqqus, but also takes the development in a new direction.

Although the Syzitus project has has the blessing of the former Ruqqus administrators, it is not affiliated with them. Syzitus has none of the original Ruqqus data either - it is a fresh start.

Returning users should also check the [terms of service](/help/terms), [site rules](/help/rules), and [other Help documentation](/help) to familiarize themselves with the differences from the original platform.
