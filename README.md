## Why Ruqqus?

A moderator has the power to "kick" a user-submitted post from their community (guild) but never delete it off the platform entirely. Kicked posts end up in a catch-all guild called [+general](https://ruqqus.com/+general). Content that violates the [site-wide policy](https://ruqqus.com/help/terms) is removed by the core team.

Moderators, called guild masters, can only moderate a maximum of 10 guilds.

We do not serve ads. Put simply, advertisements lead to censorship. Ruqqus is funded out-of-pocket by the core team and through donations from users.

Ruqqus is responsive and mobile browser-friendly.
