#{{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} Content Policy

{{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} is a free speech environment. However, in order to ensure the safety of our users as well as the longevity of the platform, there are a few things you are not permitted to do with the {{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} platform.

By using {{ "SERVER_NAME" | app_config }}, you agree to follow these rules. Violations (in {{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }}'s sole discretion) may lead to the suspension of your {{ "SERVER_NAME" | app_config }} account.

## 1: Intellectual Property

You may not upload to, embed within, or link out from {{ "SERVER_NAME" | app_config }}:

1. Copyrighted material that you are not authorized to distribute
2. Anything not legal to publish within, or export from, the United States of America

## 2: Digital Safety

You may not upload to, embed within, or link out from {{ "SERVER_NAME" | app_config }}:

1. Digitally malicious content
2. URL shorteners
3. Anything that breaks {{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }}

## 3: User Safety

You may not use {{ "SERVER_NAME" | app_config }} to do any of the following:

1. Threaten, intimidate, or harrass other users
2. Impersonate {{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} staff
3. Solicit, collect, or publish private personal information, either yours or another individual's
4. Spam

> Generally, we interpret harassment to be conduct that cannot be stopped using the site's built-in blocking features. Examples of such conduct include (but are not limited to) the use of multiple accounts to evade blocks, and the coordination of harassing activities across multiple users.

## 4: Sexual Content

You may not upload to, embed within, or link out from {{ "SERVER_NAME" | app_config }}:

1. Sexual or sexually suggestive material not marked "NSFW"
2. Sexual or sexually suggestive material involving individuals under the age of 18, including fictitious content. Solicitation of such material is also prohibited.
3. Sexual or sexually suggestive material involving individuals who did not consent to its creation and distribution (commonly called "revenge pornography" or "involuntary pornography"). Solicitation of such material is also prohibited.

> As a rule of thumb, if it features exposed genitalia outside of a strictly medical/educational context, it's probably adult content, and should be marked as such.

## 5: IRL Safety

You may not use {{ "SERVER_NAME" | app_config }} to do any of the following:

1. Incite, plan, or execute unlawful or violent activity
2. Engage in fraud

## 6: Evil

While it would be nice to be able to entertain all viewpoints, certain ideologies are ontologically evil. We have a zero tolerance policy on advocacy, propaganda, recruitment, and any other forms of promotion of evil.

Evil ideologies prohibited from {{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} include, but are not limited to:

* Ethnic or racial supremecism
* Pedophile acceptance/normalization
* Terrorism

Discussion of these topics as they relate to current events or other subject matter is permitted; advocacy or promotion of them is not.
