#{{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} Content Policy

{{ "SERVER_NAME" | app_config }} is a free speech environment. However, in order to ensure the safety of our users as well as the longevity of the platform, there are a few things you are not permitted to do with the Ruqqus platform.

By using ruqqus.com, you agree to follow these rules. Violations (in Ruqqus's sole discretion) may lead to the suspension of your ruqqus.com account.

## 1: Intellectual Property

You may not upload to, embed within, or link out from ruqqus.com:

1. Copyrighted material that you are not authorized to distribute
2. Anything not legal to publish within, or export from, the United States of America

## 2: Digital Safety

You may not upload to, embed within, or link out from ruqqus.com:

1. Digitally malicious content
2. URL shorteners
3. Anything that breaks Ruqqus

## 3: User Safety

You may not use ruqqus.com to do any of the following:

1. Threaten, intimidate, or harrass other users
2. Impersonate Ruqqus staff
3. Solicit, collect, or publish private personal information, either yours or another individual's
4. Spam

> Generally, we interpret harassment to be conduct that cannot be stopped using the site's built-in blocking features. Examples of such conduct include (but are not limited to) the use of multiple accounts to evade blocks, and the coordination of harassing activities across multiple users.

## 4: Sexual Content

You may not upload to, embed within, or link out from ruqqus.com:

1. Sexual or sexually suggestive material not marked "NSFW"
2. Sexual or sexually suggestive material involving individuals under the age of 18, including fictitious content
3. Sexual or sexually suggestive material involving individuals who did not consent to its creation and distribution (commonly called "revenge pornography" or "involuntary pornography")

> As a rule of thumb, if it features exposed genitalia outside of a strictly medical/educational context, it's probably adult content, and should be marked as such.

## 5: IRL Safety

You may not use ruqqus.com to do any of the following:

1. Incite, plan, or execute unlawful or violent activity
2. Engage in fraud

## 6: Evil

While it would be nice to be able to entertain all viewpoints, certain ideologies are ontologically evil. We have a zero tolerance policy on advocacy, propaganda, recruitment, and any other forms of promotion of evil.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* Promotion of ethnic, racial, or religious supremecist ideologies
* Advocating for the normalization of "minor attracted persons" (i.e. pedophiles)
* Recruitment for terrorist organizations

## 7: Bots

The following rules apply to clients interacting with Ruqqus in an automated manner ("Bots").

1. Bots may not vote.
2. Bots must use a unique `User-Agent` header.
3. Bots must include a `X-User-Type` header with a value of `Bot`.
4. Bots that post content must serve a useful function, such as looking up information or bridging to another service.
5. Bots must authenticate with an OAuth2 token and use `/api/v1` endpoints whenever possible.
